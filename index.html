			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p> Hai! </p>
			<p>I'm a junior majoring in electrical engineering and minoring in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </p>

			<p> In addition to taking classes, I am an active member in both WCS and ACM. I really enjoy attending the events and helping out with various projects. </p>
			
			<p> In previous summers, I have worked at SLAC National Laboratory, in the Shim group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and in the XYZ lab at Columbia University. My projects include writing software for x-ray imaging research, determining different methods for graphene growth and transfer, and fabrication and characterization of 2D heterostructures.</p>

			<p>My current interests are centered around systems and networking and data science. I am looking for internship positions that will allow me to pursue these interests, as well as the software industry as a whole.</p>

			<p> Feel free to contact me if you have any questions! </p>
